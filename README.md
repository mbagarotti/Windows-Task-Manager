# avalonia-task_manager
Note:
This code hasn't been optimized, it's just an started point througth 
simple examples to Avalonia, LiveCharts2 and XAML.

This is a simple Avalonia/LiveCharts2 project.
The idea is to bring Windows Task Manger into Avalonia with simple examples.
Can be use as a Template or starting point for any project that needs to check system resources and plot into LiveCharts2.

Currently working on CPU Data.
